title: DEF CON CTF Qualifier 2017

[DEF CON CTF Qualifier](https://ctftime.org/event/459) was humbling. No cheesy challenges here, I had to sweat for every one of them. The site design seemed very minimalistic, but flashy UI is not what it's all about.

It was a bummer that I ran out of time on ```pegem``` challenge, I was close. Didn't expect that solving the peg games was not the end of it...
