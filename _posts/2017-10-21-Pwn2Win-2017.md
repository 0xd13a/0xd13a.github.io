[Pwn2Win](https://pwn2win.party) was in interesting event - ran pretty smoothly, challeges were ... challenging :smile: and the admins were responsive. It's the first event that I saw that uses [NIZK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof) for scoring, should be a good way to cut down on questions about scoring reliability and fairness. Thanks for the great competition and learning experience!

Here are the writeups for some of the challenges that I solved:

**[Baby Regex]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/pwn2win2017/baby_regex)**

**[Top Secret]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/pwn2win2017/top_secret)**

**[Hidden Program]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/pwn2win2017/hidden_program)**

**[Resistance]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/pwn2win2017/resistance)**
