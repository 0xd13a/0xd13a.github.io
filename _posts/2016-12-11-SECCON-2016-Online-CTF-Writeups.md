title: SECCON 2016 Online CTF Writeups
draft: true

[SECCON 2016 Online CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/354) ran for just 24 hours. This defintely makes for a more intense competition, especially since the challenges did not seem to be any easier than the ones at 48-hour events.

Lots of very interesting problems to solve and technologies to learn. I came very close on ```checker``` and ```uncomfortable web```, but ran out of time. :-/ Oh well, there is always the next time. :)

Here are the writeups for the 4 challenges that I solved:

**[Vigenere]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/seccon2016/vigenere)**

**[VoIP]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/seccon2016/voip)**

**[Anti-Debugging]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/seccon2016/anti-debugging)**

**[Memory Analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/seccon2016/memory-analysis)**
