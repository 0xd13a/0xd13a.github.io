[Volga CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/539) didn't disappoint - very smoothly run, and the challenges were pretty inventive and quite complex. Great job organizers!

Some of the challenges that I liked:

**[The Colors - Listen!]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2018/colors)**

**[Lights]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2018/lights)**

**[CrackMe]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2018/crackme)**
