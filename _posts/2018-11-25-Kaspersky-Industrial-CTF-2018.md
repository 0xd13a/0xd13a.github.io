title: Kaspersky Industrial CTF 2018
draft: false
---

I have mixed impressions of [Kaspersky Industrial CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/701) - it was unusual to have no live chat, no announcements, not varying degress of challenge difficulty; the "industrial" nature of the CTF was not reflected in the problems. On the other hand the challenges were interesting and hard, so it was a great learning experience with lots of variety - from PHP serialization to .Net obfuscation. In any case - time well spent.
