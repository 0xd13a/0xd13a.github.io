[HXP CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/647) was as great as last year - well done guys! Well organized, went without a hitch, challenges were tough and mentally stimulating. Solved several, came really close on a couple more. No matter how many times you know of exploiting something there is always one more - HXP challenges are great examples of unorthodox approaches to doing things.
