There were some interesting challenges in [Insoni'hack Teaser](https://ctftime.org/event/959) but the fun was dampened a bit by a bunch of issues - some challenges were down or broken for extended periods of time, others involved guesswork rather than skill, and so on. ```pow``` challenge had an Easter egg that was 'cute', but the fact that it modified the host system was bad form. Oh well, fool me once...
