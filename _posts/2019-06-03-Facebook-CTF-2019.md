This is my first time trying [Facebook CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/781) (was it on in previous years?). The platform was not very stable - frequent errors and downtimes, but that did not affect the offline challenges, so no biggie. The challenge quality was top notch, definitely not a beginner level CTF. Thanks for the good times!
