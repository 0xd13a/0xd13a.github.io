Challenges in [Sharif CTF](http://ctf.sharif.edu/) were a good mix of different levels of difficulty. It didn't help that for about 6 or 7 hours the site went offline due to some IP blacklisting issue and was hard to reach from outside Iran. Lesson learned: download offline challenges early in order to avoid twiddling thumbs during possible outages.
