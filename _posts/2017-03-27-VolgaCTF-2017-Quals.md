Organizers did a great job with [VolgaCTF Quals](https://ctftime.org/event/374), you can tell that they have been doing this for several years. Things were very well set up and thought through, and most of it went without a hitch. Some of the online challenges were kind of slow, but the admins seemed to be responsive to requests for help and fixed challenges fairly quickly when they went down. I had a great time and learned a lot. 

Here are some of the challenges that I solved:

**[Telemap]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2017/telemap)**

**[Angry Guessing Game]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2017/angry-guessing-game)**

**[Bloody Feedback]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2017/bloody-feedback)**

**[KeyPass]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2017/keypass)**

**[PyCrypto]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/volgactf2017/pycrypto)**
