I believe I have made a significant find in the Kandarian ruins, a volume of ancient Sumarian burial practices and funerary incantations. It is entitled "Naturum De Montum", roughly translated: Book of the Dead. The book is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. It deals with demons and demon resurrection and those forces which roam the forest and dark bowers of Man's domain. The first few pages warn that these enduring creatures may lie dormant but are never truly dead.

Sure, I could have stayed in the past. I could have even been king. But in my own way, I *am* king.
I know you're scared; we're all scared, but that doesn't mean were cowards. We can take these skeletons, we can take them, with science.
Oh that's just what we call pillow talk, baby, that's all.
After all, I'm a man and you're a woman... at least last time I checked. Huh huh.
