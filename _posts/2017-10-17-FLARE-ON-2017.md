FLARE-ON 2017 was very rewarding - what a great opportunity to sharpen reverse engineering skills! I ran out of time in the middle of the last challenge but the whole thing was still totally worth it. Big thanks to the organizers - I'm tooking forward to trying it again next year!

The official writeups and copies of challenge files can be found on the [FireEye blog](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/10/2017-flare-on-challenge-solutions.html).
