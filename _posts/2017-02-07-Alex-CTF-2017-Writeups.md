Challenges in [Alex CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/408) seemed easier than the ones in some of the other CTFs I have seen and the 3 days to complete them was pretty generous. That's the best way of doing it, I think - when stress is lower you can think more creatively and come up with higher quality solutions. :smile:

Some challenges were very simple - you could find the flag by doing a search. Here are the ones that seemed more interesting:

**[C++ is awesome]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/alexctf2017/c++-is-awesome)**

**[Catalyst system]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/alexctf2017/catalyst-system)**

**[unVM me]({{ site.baseurl }}/ctfs/alexctf2017/unvm-me)**
