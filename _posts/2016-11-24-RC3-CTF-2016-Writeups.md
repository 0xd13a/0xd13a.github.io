Last weekend [RIT Competitive Cybersecurity Club](https://rc3.club/) hosted [RC3 CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/389). All in all it was a 
great competition and a very stimulating learning experience. Below are the writeups for some of the challenges that I solved.

**[Some Pang](#some-pang)**

Right off the bat there are a lot of clues to how the flag is encoded. The Caesar quote and challenge name both point to [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). Also we know that the flags are in format ```RC3-2016-xxx```, so the first two sections of the encoded flag are likely ```RC3-2016-```.

Let's try substituting letters and numbers from that section into a simple encoding table:

```
0123456789 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
ghij  m      s              7
```

We can see a pattern developing, so let's fill out the rest of the table:

```
0123456789 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
ghijklmnop qrstuvwxyz0123456789abcdef
```

We can now decode the flag: ```RC3-2016-ROMANGOD```.
